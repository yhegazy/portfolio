// About [Large font text, justify-start, block]
// Welcome to my humble abode. My name is Yahia Hegazy. 
// Like many others, I, too, am a web developer. 
// Many of my designs revolve around minimalism as I am one at heart.
// This site is a testament to my experience as well as showcasing my art through my work. 
// None of it is pretty, but where we begin never does. Only through continuance does it ever improve.
// Please enjoy.
